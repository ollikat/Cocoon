Cocoon, wearable safety 

It’s not uncommon to feel vulnerable when you’re walking alone at night or traveling in an unfamiliar place. Every store and bank has their own security button, but what about your own security? A wearable safety cocoon is a perfect product for everyone who wants to feel secure in their everyday life. The wearable safety Cocoon is easy to attach to your accessories or even clothes.  How does it work? In the event of an attack, the last thing you want is to lose your voice. But in a panicked state, the adrenalin surge can render a person speechless. The wearable safety cocoon can break the silence. Cocoon can be modified to suit your needs. The built in gps tracker when triggered will send a direct alert to nearest emergency services or your closest friend or relatives. It sends your profile with your name and location. This can be done only with one press of button.  

Help us to create and improve an interface for modifying wearable safety Cocoons.
